# React Portfolio

## Description
Taking my portfolio that I created solely with HTML and CSS, and recreating it as closely as I could using React.  It is a site which consists of three routes,  with pages giving some background information about myself along with a resume download button, contact details and a portfolio page detailing some recent work.  This gives a central location to bring together all aspects of my development as a full stack developer, and includes links to GitHub and LinkedIn.
